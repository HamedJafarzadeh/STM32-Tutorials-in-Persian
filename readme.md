# STM32 Series tutorials using STM32CubeMX and Eclipse IDE

These are the training video files held at Ferdowsi University of Mashhad Robotics Community in 2016. Although these tutorials are not meant to be released publicly at recording time, but I found them helpful in some occasions. So I'm realising them  `as it is` , I hope it could be helpful for some people.

Please note that for each section, we have a presentation file for theoretical part of training in the corresponding directory and also a programming video related to those section on following YouTube playlist.

And sorry for Persian language of the video files, but if you have any question about any part feel free to ask me question in the issue section on in the comments of video, I would be very happy to answer.

I have to mention that these classes have been held by 

- Hamed Jafarzadeh (Me)
- Afshin Alagheband
- Sadra Naddaf
- Sina darvishi
- Alireza Esfahani 

Thank you all, for helping me holding these classes and now being helpful to others as well.
